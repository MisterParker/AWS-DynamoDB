# AWS-DynamoDB
Querying and managing AWS DynamoDB using python

We have used Python and Boto 3, the AWS SDK for Python, for interacting with the DynamoDB APIs.

NOTE: You can either install the AWS CLI or you can just use AWS Cloud 9 that is A cloud IDE for writing, running, and debugging code

You can use AWS Free Tier Services to play around with AWS and everything it offers.
